# LiteMUD

This is a learning experience for me, trying to make a MUD (Multi User Dungeon)
style game in Python, using as few runtime dependencies as possible.

The actual gameplay aspect is WIP for now the focus is on getting an engine up
and running. I will also be including a web client to connect to the game,
however I would also like to support raw telnet connections and potentially
even connections from other popular MUD clients in the future.
